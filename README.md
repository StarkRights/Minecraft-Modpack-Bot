# Minecraft-Modpack-Bot
A discord bot to search &amp; display information about minecraft mods &amp; modpacks
###### Functionality
This bot utilizes the ModPackIndex API in order to allow discord users to search/query data from Curseforge Mod & Modpack projects.

Features include:<br>
- Searching ModPacks & Packs
   - Detailed information about results (Latest Version, Downloads, Author, etc.)
- Searching for Packs that include a mod
- Searching for the mods in a Pack

All sorted by Curse's popularity ranking.<br>
Ideally in the future, it will also incorporate data from other launchers as well (Technic/AT/The new FTB App)- but for now, the MPI API is enough work.

## Thanks
Infinite thanks to [Headline](https://github.com/Headline) for enduring countless novice questions, watching me struggle, and being my overall impromptu mentor for this project. I couldn't have made this anywhere near what it is without his help.<br>
Additionally, thanks to Washclof, for providing the absolutely amazing [ModPackIndex API](https://modpackindex.docs.apiary.io/), which this bot is literally built ontop of, when Curse couldn't/wouldn't. This probably wouldn't exist at all if his API wasn't there.
